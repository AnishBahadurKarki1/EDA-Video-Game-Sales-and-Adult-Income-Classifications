## 🎮 Video Game Sales Prediction (Regression Project)

### Overview

This project focuses on predicting **global video game sales** using Machine Learning. A **Linear Regression** model was trained on a public Video Game Sales dataset to analyze trends and estimate sales performance based on various features.

### Key Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature selection and normalization
* Linear Regression model training
* Model evaluation using train/test split
* Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

### Objective

To understand video game sales patterns and predict global sales using regression techniques.

## 🧠 Adult Income Classification (Machine Learning Project)

### Overview

This project aims to classify individuals into income categories using the **Adult Income dataset**. A **Logistic Regression** model was developed to predict whether an individual's income exceeds a specified threshold based on demographic features.

### Key Features

* Data preprocessing and categorical encoding
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature scaling
* Logistic Regression model implementation
* Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics
* Train/test split for validation

### Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn
* Matplotlib

### Objective

To build a supervised classification model that predicts income levels based on demographic data.
